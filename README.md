# E-commerce Furniture Dataset 2024 - Sales Prediction Project

## üìÖ Project Title:
**E-commerce Furniture Dataset 2024 - Predictive Analysis of Furniture Sales**

## üìö Overview
This project focuses on predicting the number of furniture items sold based on their features such as price, title, and tag information. The dataset, sourced from AliExpress, contains 2,000 product entries and provides a solid foundation for applying data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and machine learning techniques.

## üß™ Objective
To analyze and predict the sales performance (`sold`) of e-commerce furniture products using machine learning models based on available features like `price`, `tagText`, and `productTitle`.

## üìÉ Dataset Summary
- **Source:** AliExpress (Scraped using Apify)
- **Entries:** 2,000 rows
- **Columns:**
  - `productTitle`: Name of the item
  - `originalPrice`: Original price (contains missing values)
  - `price`: Current selling price
  - `sold`: Number of units sold
  - `tagText`: Tag/Shipping info (e.g., "Free shipping")

## üîß Tools & Technologies
- Python
- pandas, numpy
- matplotlib, seaborn
- scikit-learn (Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor)

## üîÑ Project Pipeline

### 1. Data Collection
Dataset was loaded using `pandas.read_csv()`.

### 2. Data Preprocessing
- Removed missing values and dropped the `originalPrice` column due to >75% nulls
- Converted `price` to float
- Encoded `tagText` using Label Encoding
- Simplified `tagText` into categories: `Free shipping`, `+Shipping: $5.09`, and `others`

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualized the distribution of `price` and `sold`
- Analyzed correlation using scatterplots and pairplots
- Identified concentration of sales around low-cost and free-shipping items

### 4. Feature Engineering
- Created TF-IDF features from `productTitle`
- Merged TF-IDF vectors with the main dataset
- Dropped `productTitle` after encoding

### 5. Model Building
- Train-Test Split: 80/20
- Models Used:
  - Linear Regression
  - Random Forest Regressor (n_estimators=100)

### 6. Model Evaluation
- Evaluation Metrics:
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
  - R-squared Score (R2)
- Random Forest outperformed Linear Regression due to better handling of nonlinear data

### 7. Conclusion
Random Forest Regressor showed superior performance. Feature engineering, especially TF-IDF and tag encoding, contributed positively. The model can guide e-commerce platforms in optimizing listings, pricing, and marketing strategies.

## üéì Learnings
